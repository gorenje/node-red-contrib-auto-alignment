# Auto Layout of Node-RED Flows

Auto Layout Node-RED node flows.

### Warning

This node uses third-party Javascript libraries to do node alignment. The following libs will be loaded into your browser upon use:

- [elk.bundled.js](https://cdn.openmindmap.org/thirdparty/elk.bundled.js) 
- [dagre.min.js](https://cdn.openmindmap.org/thirdparty/dagre.min.js) 

both from cdn.openmindmap.org.

### Usage

Select a single node in a flow that should be aligned/laid out. Then hit the button no this node. Select the algorithm in the property panel.

The [example flow](https://flowhub.org/f/b22f47c724215b2a) provides one node per algorithm so that each can be tested in turn.
